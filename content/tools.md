I often get questions about my setup and the software I use. Most of the time, it’s something like, “How do I make my desktop look cool like yours?” So, here’s a page detailing everything I use daily.

My motivation behind choosing my operating system and software is to maximize efficiency and work seamlessly. I aim to use my computer “at the speed of thought,” which is why I prefer minimal yet powerful tools. This setup works best for me, but it may not be for everyone.

## Software

- Working as Both Graphic Designer and Video Editor, I use **[Window](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows11)** as my Operation System as it is greate for those tool like **photoshop** and **after effect**

- **[GlazeWM](https://github.com/glzr-io/glazewm)** for tilling window
- **[Yasb](https://github.com/Alexhttps://github.com/amnweb/yasbays/Waybar)** serves as my status bar at the top.

- For my terminal I try various terminal emulator and there is no specify thing that long term used but for now I use **Wezterm** because it feel modern,easy to customization. My shell is **Pwsh**, it is not a unix system and i come to discover other shell like **zsh** when i already download ton of thing in pwsh already that why i don't use zsh so i don't want to mess up my set up.

## Applications

I start using **Neovim** for all of my coding. It is so hard for me to learn vim at first but it paid off with how quickly i can navigate thing in neovim and now all of my other plugin also use vim motion.

**VSCode** is my secondary code editor when i have to use ai because i dont't have money to pay for claude code :) as vscode offer a free tool call cline with gemini api key.

For note-taking, I use **Obsidian**. I haven’t been using it for very long, and I’m still exploring its features, but so far, it’s been great for organizing knowledge efficiently.

For image editing, I use **Photoshop** and **After Effect** For _VFX_ and **Davinvi** for normal clip. Do I have to say why i use it seen it is very popular?

For office work, I use **WPS Office**, which offers great compatibility with Microsoft Office formats.

## Theme

- I use the **Solarized Osaka** and **Catpucinna** For Everything.
- For my terminal font, I use **[Fantasque Sans Mono](https://github.com/belluzj/fantasque-sans)**. Of course, I also use [Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) icons.

## This Website

- This site is built with **[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)** and **PaperMod theme**, Hugo a static site generator that just outputs HTML and CSS instead of the bloated mess that is most of the modern web.
- The source code is available on my **[GitHub](https://github.com/ArtBlog/ARtBlog)**.
