&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m simply a normal person that loves to share her ideas with others by means of writing. One of my favorite things to do as a software engineer is write about anything from programming to technology to everything else as I find such subjects fascinating. Additionally being supportive of open-source software, I try to help the community whenever I have the chance. I wish you like reading my blog and find it to be useful. Please contact me should you have any questions or comments without hesitating. If only you could get in touch with me.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title/><link>https://itsahmad.me/tools/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://itsahmad.me/tools/</guid><description>&lt;p>I often get questions about my setup and the software I use. Most of the time, it’s something like, “How do I make my desktop look cool like yours?” So, here’s a page detailing everything I use daily.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My motivation behind choosing my operating system and software is to maximize efficiency and work seamlessly. I aim to use my computer “at the speed of thought,” which is why I prefer minimal yet powerful tools. This setup works best for me, but it may not be for everyone.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
