[{"content":"Mastering Code with the Feynman Technique: Learn Faster, Understand Deeper Learning to code isn\u0026rsquo;t just about copying and pasting syntax. It\u0026rsquo;s about understanding what the code does, how it works, and why it behaves the way it does. Whether you\u0026rsquo;re a beginner or a seasoned developer, one of the best ways to deepen your knowledge is by using the Feynman Technique.\nOriginally developed by physicist Richard Feynman, this learning method forces you to go beyond surface-level memorization. It helps you internalize complex concepts, identify gaps in your knowledge, and retain what you learn for the long term.\nüí° What is the Feynman Technique? The Feynman Technique is a four-step process:\nChoose a concept you want to understand Teach it in simple language Identify your knowledge gaps Review, simplify, and repeat The idea is simple: If you can‚Äôt explain a topic clearly to someone else (especially a child), you probably don‚Äôt fully understand it.\nFeynman believed that \u0026ldquo;the first principle is that you must not fool yourself‚Äîand you are the easiest person to fool.\u0026rdquo; The technique is built around exposing what you don‚Äôt know‚Äîso you can fix it.\nüß† Why Use the Feynman Technique to Learn Code? Programming concepts are often deeply interconnected and abstract. It\u0026rsquo;s easy to fall into the trap of memorizing without truly understanding.\nUsing the Feynman Technique helps you:\nSolidify your understanding of key coding principles Spot weaknesses in your knowledge quickly Make connections between different topics Improve your technical communication, which is useful for interviews, collaboration, and documentation üîç Step-by-Step: How to Apply the Feynman Technique to Coding Step 1: Choose a Concept Pick one concept or topic from your learning journey. It could be:\nHow functions work in Python What the this keyword does in JavaScript Differences between REST and GraphQL APIs How Git handles branching and merging React state vs props CSS specificity Start small and focused. For example, don‚Äôt try to explain all of JavaScript. Choose something like how closures work.\nStep 2: Teach It Like You‚Äôre Explaining to a 12-Year-Old Grab a piece of paper, a whiteboard, or a markdown editor. Then explain the topic in plain, simple language. Use analogies, real-world examples, and visuals if necessary.\nFor example:\nA function is like a kitchen recipe. You give it ingredients (called parameters), and it follows steps to produce something new (the return value). If you use the same recipe with different ingredients, you get a different result.\nOr:\nA for loop is like telling the computer, \u0026ldquo;Repeat this task a certain number of times.\u0026rdquo;\nAvoid technical jargon unless you can explain it too. The goal is clarity, not sounding smart.\nStep 3: Find the Gaps in Your Understanding As you try to teach the concept, you‚Äôll hit moments where you:\nCan‚Äôt explain why something works Forget a detail Feel unsure These are knowledge gaps, and they‚Äôre incredibly valuable. Go back to the docs, watch a tutorial, or read an article to strengthen that part of your understanding.\nAsk yourself:\nWhat would happen if I changed this? Can I explain this without code? Could I write this from scratch with no help? Can I give a working example? For example:\nI said .map() in JavaScript returns a new array\u0026hellip; but what if I don‚Äôt return anything from the function inside it?\nStep 4: Simplify, Refine, and Repeat Now that you\u0026rsquo;ve filled in the gaps, go back and revise your explanation. Make it even simpler. Add examples or analogies. Remove any unnecessary complexity.\nTry teaching it again‚Äîout loud, to a friend, or even by recording yourself.\nBy the end, you should feel confident that you understand the concept thoroughly.\nüíª Real Coding Example: JavaScript Closures Step 1: Topic Chosen JavaScript closures.\nStep 2: Explain Simply A closure happens when a function remembers the variables around it, even after those variables would normally be gone.\nIt‚Äôs like having a backpack‚Äîyour inner function keeps a copy of everything it needs from where it was created.\nfunction outer() { let count = 0; return function inner() { count++; return count; }; } const counter = outer(); counter(); // 1 counter(); // 2 ","permalink":"https://itsahmad.me/posts/eightyandtwenty/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"mastering-code-with-the-feynman-technique-learn-faster-understand-deeper\"\u003eMastering Code with the Feynman Technique: Learn Faster, Understand Deeper\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLearning to code isn\u0026rsquo;t just about copying and pasting syntax.
